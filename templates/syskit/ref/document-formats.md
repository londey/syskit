# Document Format Reference

## Requirements (`req_NNN_<name>.md`)

Requirements state WHAT the system must do, not HOW.

See `.syskit/ref/requirement-format.md` for the required format, quality criteria, and level-of-abstraction guidance.

## Interfaces (`int_NNN_<name>.md`)

Interfaces define contracts. They may be:

- **Internal:** Defined by this project (register maps, packet formats, internal APIs)
- **External:** Defined elsewhere (PNG format, SPI protocol, USB spec)

For external interfaces, document:

- The external specification and version
- How this system uses/constrains it
- What subset of features are supported

For internal interfaces, the document IS the specification.

## Design Units (`unit_NNN_<name>.md`)

Design units describe HOW a piece of the system works.

- Reference requirements being implemented with `REQ-NNN`
- Reference interfaces being implemented/consumed with `INT-NNN`
- Document internal interfaces to other units
- Link to implementation files in `src/`
