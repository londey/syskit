# Requirement Format Reference

## Required Format

Every requirement must use the condition/response pattern:

> **When** [condition/trigger], the system **SHALL/SHOULD/MAY** [observable behavior/response].

- **SHALL** = mandatory, **SHOULD** = recommended, **MAY** = optional
- Reference interfaces with `INT-NNN`
- Allocate to design units with `UNIT-NNN`

## Quality Criteria

Each requirement must be:

- **Necessary:** Removing it would cause a system deficiency
- **Singular:** Addresses one thing only — split compound requirements
- **Correct:** Accurately describes the needed capability
- **Unambiguous:** Has only one possible interpretation — no vague terms
- **Feasible:** Can be implemented within known constraints
- **Appropriate to Level:** Describes capabilities/behaviors, not implementation mechanisms
- **Complete:** Contains all information needed to implement and verify
- **Conforming:** Uses the project's standard template and condition/response format
- **Verifiable:** The condition defines the test setup; the behavior defines the pass criterion

## Level of Abstraction

If a requirement describes data layout, register fields, byte encoding, packet structure, memory maps, or wire protocols, that detail belongs in an interface document (`INT-NNN`), not a requirement. The requirement should reference the interface.

- Wrong: "The system SHALL have an error counter" *(no condition, not testable)*
- Wrong: "The system SHALL transmit a 16-byte header with bytes 0-3 as a big-endian sequence number" *(implementation detail, belongs in an interface)*
- Right: "When the system receives a malformed message, the system SHALL discard the message and increment the error counter"
- Right: "When the system transmits a message, the system SHALL include a unique sequence number per INT-005"
